Congress Assistant
==================
This is a PHP Web-Application based on the [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter "CodeIgniter") framework and initially created for the ESEB 2011 Congress in TÃ¼bingen.

Its purposes were:

* Synchronizing the time slots for talks in multiple lecture halls, by displaying a countdown during talks and a timeline of upcoming events and customizable slides for announcements between them. This is implemented via a [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/ "backbone.js") based frontend accessing the php backend. Time synchronization is done by continuously fetching a master time from the the server.
* Serving webpages to assist in organizing our different student activities (Meet a Silverback, Poster Invitations, ...)
* Sending personalized Emails to different groups of attendants (Note that sending Emails should be done via a cron task executing 'php $WEB_HOME/index.php cron sendmail')
